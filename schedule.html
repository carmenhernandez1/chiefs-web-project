            The Chiefs will play preseason games before they play the regular games, then after the regular season games they will go into playoff games. <br> <br>
            There are 4 quarters in each half, and they are 15mins long with a 20mi long halftime show.<br> 
            The chiefs almost made it to the super bowl last year and we are really hoping that they make it this year. <br>
            <br> Chiefs fans have the best tailages, there are some people who get up at 6am go to go the parking lot to be able to get into the stadium and be able to start having fun! My brothers tailgates have been featured on TV, because someone got married at our tailgate! So cool!
